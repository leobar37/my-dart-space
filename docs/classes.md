## Classes 

Dart is an object-oriented languaje
with classes and mixin-based inheritance

> Every object is an instance of a class
> an all class except null descendent from null

Mixin-based inheritance  means that although every 
class has a exactly a superclass. a class body can be reused
in multiple class hierarchies.
